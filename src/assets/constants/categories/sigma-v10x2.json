{"description":"# NFT Platform Index (NFTP)\nThe NFT Platform Index aims to provide wide exposure to the protocol and governance tokens of the increasingly popular NFT sector. Candidate members have circulating market capitalisations ranging from US$50 million to US$5 billion.\n\n## Methodology\nThe NFTP Index weights components according to the square root of their circulating market cap, the data for which is queried from off-chain data sources using an oracle service. NFTP has a 'candidate' list of eligible tokens, which is filtered on-chain to remove any tokens with market capitalisations outside of the above bounds. The candidate list is sorted once a month in descending order of market capitalisation, and the top 10 eligible assets are selected as the target index constituents. The constituent assets are re-weighted weekly.\n\n## Inclusion Criteria\nThe NFTP Index has the following criteria for inclusion:\n\n* The token has a market cap ranging from US$50 million to US$5 billion.\n* No major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the token contract.\n* The token’s supply can not be arbitrarily inflated or deflated maliciously.\n* The control model should be considered if the supply can be modified through governance decisions.\n  * The token does not have transfer fees or other non-standard balance updates.\n* The token meets the requirements of the ERC20 standard.\n  * Boolean return values are not required.\n* Sufficient liquidity is locked in the Uniswap market pair between the token and WETH.\n* The token is one of:\n  * Protocol or governance token for an NFT-centric Ethereum-based project.\n  * Wrapper token for a cross-chain NFT-centric blockchain’s native currency.","name":"NFT Platform Index","symbol":"NFTP"}
