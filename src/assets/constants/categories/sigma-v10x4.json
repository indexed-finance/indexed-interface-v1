{"description":"# The Future Of Finance Fund (FFF)\nThe Future Of Finance Fund aims to be a one-stop shop for exposure to the cryptocurrency investing space. It is an ETF with a 40% focus on Bitcoin and Ether, significant exposure to Ethereum-based large/medium-cap DeFi protocols, and a small grouping of higher risk/reward assets across Ethereum with a greater chance of upside. As the Indexed protocol evolves, this latter category will be replaced with a stablecoin yield-farming component.\n\n## Methodology\nThe FFF pegs WETH and WBTC to a fixed weight of 20% each and weights the remaining components according to the square root of their circulating market cap, the data for which is queried from off-chain data sources using an oracle service. Non-pegged ETF components are reweighed weekly.\n\n## Inclusion Criteria\nThe FFF has the following criteria for inclusion:\n\n* No major vulnerabilities have been discovered in the token contract.\n* The tokenâ€™s supply can not be arbitrarily inflated or deflated maliciously.\n* The control model should be considered if the supply can be modified through governance decisions.\n  * The token does not have transfer fees or other non-standard balance updates.\n* The token meets the requirements of the ERC20 standard.\n  * Boolean return values are not required.\n* Sufficient liquidity is locked in the Uniswap V2 market pair between the token and WETH.\n* The token is one of:\n  * Wrapped Ether,\n  * Wrapped Bitcoin, or\n  * An Indexed ETF product (such as DEFI5 or CC10).","name":"Future of Finance Fund","symbol":"FFF"}
